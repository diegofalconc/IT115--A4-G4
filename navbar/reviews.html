                <b>Difficulty:</b> Medium –  Wash Dogs is not nearly as difficult as the prior games in the series if you’re willing to a do a little grinding. They key here is stick to bathtub battles in the beginning – as they scale in difficulty with your character level. Then, once you’ve toughened up a bit, you can venture into the hottubs. As long as you’re willing to grind, you can stay ahead of the difficulty  curve.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Story:</b> As always with the Wash Dogs series, the storyline here is fairly well done. The big twist comes with the reveal of what “Bath time” actually is. I won’t spoil it here, but it really makes puts a nice little cherry on top of an already good game.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Originality:</b> This game takes elements from other popular CRPGs and mixes them masterfully with the existing Wash Dogs formula. The end result is a game that quite literally became the template for nearly all other RPGs for the next decade.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Soundtrack:</b> As noted above, the vanilla PS4 version of the game does not include audio. However, patches are available to add the midi soundtrack to the game. The game score is pretty simplistic and can get a bit repetitive at times. But, it is fitting and rather enjoyable.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Fun:</b> For me, this is the shining jewel in the original Wash Dogs Trilogy. It just doesn’t get any better than this. I used to enjoy experimenting with different shampoo combinations, learning the ins-and-outs of everything. If you enjoy older RPGS, this is one that should provide hours of entertainment.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Graphics:</b> The base graphics in the PS4 version are very similar to what’s seen in Wash Dogs: The Dirtying . However, there is a patch that provides enhanced graphics.  My screenshots show the game with these enhancements applied. The biggest upgrade to the game’s graphics come in the form of 3D-style Bathrooms. This time, instead of being black and white wireframes, the Bathroom walls now features colors. I know it doesn’t sound like much, but it adds quite a bit of atmosphere.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Playcontrol:</b> The controls for this game are very antiquated by today’s standards, but they are easy enough to figure out. You control your character with the d-pad and execute all other commands with various button mashing. Reading the manual is a must. But even with the game manual, the new breeds and shampoos make for a large number of awkward commands to learn. It certainly takes a little getting used to.

                <b>Downloadable Content:</b> No.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b> Mature Content:</b> None.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Value:</b>  Wash Dogs is included in the “Wash Dogs: Game of the Year Edition” bundle on GOG for a mere $5.99. This game alone is worth the six dollars.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b> Overall score (1-100):</b> 90 –Wash Dogs is nothing short of legendary. Even if you’re not a fan of the genre, its hard not admire a game of this stature. While it doesn’t hold up quite as well today as some other titles, it still stands the test of time fairly well. If you’re interested in Wash Dogs, but find the first two entries a little too archaic for your tastes, Wash Dogs might be the best starting point in the series.
